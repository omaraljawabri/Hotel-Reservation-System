# üè® Hotel Reservation System 

A hotel reservation system project based on  microservices architecture using Spring Cloud and Docker

## üçÉ Microservices Architecture
### This project basically consists of 9 modules:
- **Authentication Service**: This service is responsible for manage user data, generate JWT token and authenticate an user.
- **Config Service**: This service basically manage the configuration of all another services, like application.yml or .properties files, etc.
- **Discovery Service**: This service is responsible for registry all another services using Eureka Service Discovery.
- **Gateway Service**: This service is responsible for handle client requests and route them to the correct service, centralizing all requests. Spring Cloud Gateway was used here.
- **Hotel Service**: This service is responsible for handling hotel data. 
- **Notification Service**: This service is basically responsible for sending emails with important informations about reservations, payments, etc.
- **Payment Service**: This service is responsible for handling payment data.
- **Reservation Service**: This service is responsible for handling reservation data.
- **Room Service**: This service is responsible for handling room data.

## üõ¢Ô∏è Databases 
Following a microservices architecture, each service in this project has its own database. The databases used by the services are PostgreSQL as SQL database and MongoDB as NOSQL database. The services **authentication-service**, **hotel-service**, **payment-service**, **reservation-service** and **room-service** used PostgreSQL as the database and FlyWay for database migrations. While **notification-service** used MongoDB as database.

## Communication between microservices
Two types of communication were used to communicate between micro services: synchronous and asynchronous. OpenFeign was used for synchronous communication, while Apache Kafka was used for asynchronous communication. **The communication scheme is:**

- Communication between any service with notification-service: Apache Kafka.
- Communication between two services that there are not notification-service: Open OpenFeign

## üìã Requirements 

    Docker installed and running on your local machine

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to start services locally with docker

    1. Clone this repository or download the zip version and unzip it
    2. Open the terminal in your application
    3. Type the command: docker-compose -f docker-compose-db.yml up -d
    4. Wait until all the containers are up and running
    5. Type the command: docker-compose -f docker-compose-services.yml up -d
    6. The application is up! http://localhost:8080

##  üìÑ  Documentation
